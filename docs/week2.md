### Week 2 Lesson 1

#### Readings
[Password Similarity Models using Neural NetworksFile](Readings/week2_1_cropped.md)
	
[True2F - Backdoor-resistant authentication tokensFile](Readings/week2_2_cropped.md)


#### Lecture notes
1. Pseudonymity? Freely to talk to someone who is anonymous?

2. Non-repudiation?

3. Why was the username-based merging technique not accurate?

4. Better explain what's the detail for 1000 query budget?

5. It's funny to see that the researchs found their credentials in the leak.

6. Good way to improve wiriting?

7. How is calculating the DNN computationally hard?
### Week 2 Lesson 2

#### Reading
[3 Designing for Audit A Voting Machine with a Tiny TCBFile](Readings/week2_3_cropped.md)

#### Lecture notes
1. TCB is Trusted computing base. The smaller its surface is, the less attack can penertrate it.

2. Viruses exist in env where programs have access to modify other programs' code.(e.g. MS-DOS, Windows, that's why unix systems has less viruses than dos systems.) 

3. Definitions behind common terms for malicious software:(meeting-6,P15)
	Trojan Horse
	Backdoor
	Logic Bomb
	Virus
	Worm
	Root Kit

4. Binary code is more vulnerable because it's without code?

5. Poor ballot design, the first option will easily gets selected.  

6. Brifely explain the binary code is more vulnerable? Source code is more solid? Due to the hash check?

7. Surprise recounts equals random recounts? Recount?

8. Skill level needed to hide malicious code is much lower than needed to find it.

9. 56-bit DES + 8 bit
