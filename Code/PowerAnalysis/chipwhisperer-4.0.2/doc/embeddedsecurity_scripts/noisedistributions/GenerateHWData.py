# This file takes a bunch of trace files, and generates lists of the measurement
# of current for each hamming weight (0,1,2,...,8). This can be used to then
# look for what the noise distribution is around each of the measurements, to
# check if we have gaussian noise as expected.
#
# Saves results in a .npy and .mat format (NumPY & MATLAB respectively) for
# processing.
