Note that project files are now auto-generated for ISE. This prevents annoying commit conflicts, as the files are very frequently updated automatically
by the tools.

To auto-generate the files, run the 'makeprojects_win.bat' file (Windows) or as a shell script (Linux). You should only need to run this once,
unless you want updates to the input project file.
